# Paddlify
Paddlify is a game that the player moves the paddle at the bottom to prevent the ball from hitting the bottom edge.
Player can move the paddle to left, right, or keep it at the same location, and this movement can be done at each second round.
If the ball hits one or more bricks, then the bricks disappear, and ball bounces back. The ball also bounces back if it hits left, right,
or top edges of the screen. There are two types of bricks as X and Y. If ball hits an X brick, then only that brick disappears.
However, if it hits a Y brick, then that brick and all the other bricks around it disappears. 
Player loses when the ball hits the bottom edge.
